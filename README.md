# Atari_Ecole_Centrale_de_Lyon

This project realises an FPGA-based clone of the Atari 2600 video game console.

Most of the source codes used are from the project Retromaster on Github, and also on their website: <http://retromaster.wordpress.com/a2601>, for which we express our sincere gratitude.

Based on the structures of the project Retromaster, we realised relevant simulations and obtained correct results.
